AkinatorGame: Periodic Table Elements Edition 🧪🎮
Welcome to AkinatorGame, a fun and educational Python project that puts a unique twist on the classic Akinator game by focusing on the fascinating world of periodic table elements! 🚀

Overview
AkinatorGame is a console-based game where players can think of any element from the periodic table, and the program will attempt to guess the chosen element by asking a series of insightful yes/no questions. Behind the scenes, this game leverages the power of a decision tree algorithm to make intelligent guesses based on the user's responses.

🌟 Features
Periodic Table Fun: Explore the periodic table in a playful way as you challenge the Akinator to guess your chosen element.

Decision Tree Magic: Witness the decision tree algorithm at work, dynamically adapting and narrowing down possibilities to guess the element with the least number of questions.

Educational Experience: Learn interesting facts about periodic table elements while playing the game, making it a delightful blend of entertainment and education.
